Written description of your approach to the redesign that outlines your overall concept and/or theme and how you hope to impact/affect the user:

The CSS Zen Garden is a place of meditation, reflection, and creative practice where the slate is cleared anew every day. These qualities can be communicated through a web design that conveys a sense of playful experimentation as well as space for contemplation. 

The content of the site has a spoke and wheel structure with a main theme page linking to other pages containing resources for the project. The site is primarily navigational with many links to resource pages, but I will include interactive elements to engage the user in the project.

The ultimate goal for user experience is to encourage user participation in the project. This will be accomplished by engaging the user using a clear and accessible presentation of content along with interactive exploration of resources.  

I plan to use a banner that spans the width of the screen and background image that will visually engage the user and express a sense of vast potential space. Interactive buttons will express a sense of playfulness and encourage active exploration of project designs.
